# Patatap Clone
A clone of the patatap site made with Paper.js and Howler.js

This project is part of a Web Development course I took. This part focuses specifically on using other JavaScript libraries besides jQuery, specifically Paper.js and Howler.js.

The goal was to create a clone of Patatap.com, a website where each keyboard letter that user presses has a specific animation and sound assigned to it.

It features a lot of JavaScript coding, along with the methods already present in both libraries.
